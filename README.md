# Tic Tac Toe in Python (OOP)

A simple implementation of the classic Tic Tac Toe game using Python and Object-Oriented Programming (OOP). Two players can play against each other, with win and draw detection built in.

## Features
- Built using OOP principles for clarity and modularity.
- Applied SOLID principles and some design patterns to have a cleaner and better code.
- Simple GUI to make the game more interactive
- Players can set their names and symbols.
- Detects wins, draws, and handles invalid moves.
- User-friendly menus for starting, restarting, or exiting the game.
- Connected the game to a database to store players names and symbols, game result and time
